    The main content of the application is a collection
    of twenty (20) artwork images gathered via querying the iTunes Search API. The
    initial set of images should correspond to some default query. If the
    application is in "play mode", then every two (2) seconds, a random image 
    that is currently being displayed should be replaced with a random image 
    that is not currently being displayed (assuming more than 20 images are
    gathered from the response to the search query).
